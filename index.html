            <p class="post-description">TikTok, the popular video-sharing platform owned by ByteDance, is making a
                significant shift in its content moderation strategy by laying off hundreds of human moderators and
                increasing its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for content review. This move, which primarily
                affects employees in Malaysia and the UK, is part of the company's efforts to enhance efficiency and
                scalability in managing the growing volume and complexity of user-generated content.</p>
